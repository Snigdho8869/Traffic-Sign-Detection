# Traffic Sign Detection and Classification üö¶

This repository contains code for **traffic sign detection and classification**, featuring both traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning approaches. It includes a **Flask-based web application** for real-time traffic sign detection and classification using a pre-trained deep learning model. The project leverages **TensorFlow** for image classification, **OpenCV** for image processing, and **Flask** for the web interface.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Traffic Sign Detection**: Detect traffic signs using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and a Random Forest classifier.
- **Traffic Sign Classification**: Classify traffic signs using a deep learning model based on transfer learning with the InceptionV3 architecture.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly Flask-based web app for uploading images and viewing detection results in real-time.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation for improved model performance.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves **97.62% accuracy** with the InceptionV3 model and **92.07% accuracy** with the Random Forest classifier.

## Workflow Overview üß†

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Class labels are loaded from CSV files.
- Images are resized, normalized, and preprocessed for feature extraction and classification.
- Data augmentation is applied to the training set for improved model generalization.

### 2. Traffic Sign Detection with HOG Features
- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** features are extracted from each image.
- A **Random Forest classifier** is trained to detect traffic signs.
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and a classification report.

### 3. Traffic Sign Classification with Transfer Learning
- **Transfer learning** is used with the **InceptionV3** architecture pre-trained on ImageNet.
- Additional layers are added for traffic sign classification.
- The model is trained and evaluated using training and validation sets.

### 4. Web Application
- Users can upload an image of a traffic sign via the web interface.
- The pre-trained TensorFlow model predicts the traffic sign class.
- The detected traffic sign name is displayed on the web page.
